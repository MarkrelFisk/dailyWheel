# dailyWheel

# the daily scrum wheel of fortune #

- initial
    + check box for recurring team members (should be able to add and remove)
    + a list to see attending players
    + a button to start the random choice
    + some feedback on who won

- advanced
    + wheel or similar (some creative alternative?) that animates the names and shows the choice (this could just be bubbles with the names floating around and then one pops and magnifies to fill the screen?)
    + cool ui
    + weighted chances based on number of wins? (checkable)
    + cool stats - on player number of wins, participation etc. (is this possible/allowed?). database to write the data? (simple txt in github - save all values, and then update the avg, unique players etc in the first line of the csv file)
